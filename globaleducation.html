    <h1>Global Education in BCA</h1>
    <h3>Global Education Initiative provides our students the opportunities to collaborate with their
peers from around the world. Our students learn respect for values and traditions from other
countries as they prepare for a potential future in a global economy and workforce.</h3>
    <h3><i>BCA Global Programs in the 2014-2015 School Year</i></h3>
    <p><b>November 2014:</b> Sister School collaboration with Kohutaiji High School (KHS), Hiroshima, Japan - Now, for the third time, BCA students took to the stage in Japan to share joint research-this time on their efforts to capture and harvest an asteroid. With a display of technological dexterity and skill, the students performed a live demonstration of their work to present their findings to more than 2,000 students from Hiroshima prefecture. In addition to the presentation of research, representatives from the Japanese Prefectural Board, the Ministry of Education, and almost 1,000 students gathered in the KHS gymnasium to witness the signing of the agreement to extend the ongoing partnership.
        <br><b>November 2014:</b> ABFIB International Experience: London - For the first time, in November 2014, students from the Academy for Business and Finance/International Baccalaureate Program were offered an international educational experience. London was chosen as the inaugural destination for its global prominence in business and economics as well as a nonexistent language barrier. The trip was designed from the ground up around four themes—Corporate Visits, CAS ( IB Community Service), Global Education, and Cultural Experiences. Through these experiences the 34 ABF students and 3 chaperones bonded together and returned to the US with not only a new appreciation for the world, but a new appreciation for the IB Diploma and for each other.
        <br><b>February 2015:</b>2014-2015 International Art-Design STEM Program by Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Ulsan, South Korea - Ulsan Science High School (USHS) and Bergen County Academies continued their ongoing relationship by attending this one week program focused on scientific research techniques. The program included UNIST professors' research presentations and their the state-of-the-art laboratory tours, industry visits (Hyundai Motors, Hyundai Heavy Industry Shipyards), with culminations of student presentations from both BCA and USHS. It is the hope of both schools that this program will be a catalyst for future joint research projects and summer study abroad events.</p>
