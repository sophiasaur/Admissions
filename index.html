We offer students a unique high school experience that combines comprehensive academics with technical and professional courses. We encourage our students to choose an academy concentration based upon their interests rather than a future career choice.</p>

        <p>Pursue your passion for science, art, computers, music, theatre, cooking, design, or finance-our programs will allow you to explore your interest while preparing you to meet the academic challenge of college. You may complement your studies with electives and clubs that cross academy boundaries; you are not limited to study in just one field. Students receive a fine academic background that prepares them well for postsecondary study in any field they choose.</p>
