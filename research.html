        <h1>Research Opportunities:</h1>
        <h3>Students at the Academies learn science by conducting hands-on research in our state-of-the-art
facilities. The goal of our research program is to enable students to learn how to think and work
similar to scientists. Research students learn to stretch beyond the numbers and terminology of
science. They learn how to devise scientific questions, to acquire and analyze data, and to properly communicate their ideas. Sustainability and environmental soundness are considerations in
designing projects. Currently, our research program includes the five following options:</h3>

        <h2>Our Mission:</h2>
        <p>The mission of BCA Research is to expose students to scientific inquiry, research and instrumentation, and to provide transferable, first-hand experiences with the techniques, practices and perspectives of professional scientists. By expanding the capabilities and context of secondary science education, we believe that students will be better equipped for, and more likely to pursue leadership positions in science, scientific research and global-scale problem solving. The foundations of the research program at BCA are deeply rooted in providing a real-world research environment for students to develop the independence, accountability, vision and drive to become outstanding members and future leaders within the science community. Our research program is based on six foundational principles, which work in concert with one another, to lay the groundwork necessary to nurture and challenge students to strive for excellence. </p>
        <h2>Perspective</h2>
        <p>Perspective can be thought of as the jumping off point between traditional classroom teaching and independent research. Students gain perspective in three ways. First, they must be taught the basic principles, theories, and historical perspectives that have shaped and formed our current understanding of modern science. The second perspective is personal. Students are asked what in science or society truly interests them, connects with them, or affects them. If given unlimited resources, what question would they want to study, and what problem would they want to solve. This internal perspective can be intimidating, but it allows students to begin to think like a scientist, and creates an immediate investment in the research. Since the student developed the idea, they feel a greater sense of accountability when it comes to its success or failure. Students third gain perspective on the current state of science and research. Students must understand what research is currently being conducted by performing primary literature searches on their topic. This is an important, but difficult stage for the students. Understanding where to go to locate journal articles and how to dissect out the pertinent information is a skill that takes practice and patience, but will be valuable for the student beyond high school. Through the reading multiple papers on a topic, and with the guidance of the instructor, a student gains the perspective needed to develop the structure for their project, and insight into how and where research is done.</p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>Students conducting independent research come to understand the purpose of their research on two scales. The first deals with the goals of the project. When developing the project and determining necessary experiments, students must understand the purpose of performing each experiment, the possible outcomes, and the goals that are to be achieved at each stage. Understanding the purpose of each experiment forces the abstract information gathered from the primary literature to be focused into a logical progression of tests throughout the project. Next, the larger scale purpose of the research must also be considered by the student. This greater purpose normally coincides with the student’s reasons for wanting to do the project (the internal perspective previously mentioned). The perspective gained through background literature research kindles students understanding of the current state of the field and the importance of where the project would fit into the field. Thus, the greater purpose is understood by the student and is a motivator to work diligently to obtain meaningful results that may contribute to the greater body of knowledge on the subject.</p>
        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>The tools needed to carry out experimentation make up a portion of the students’ resources in a research project. Understanding how to use an instrument and obtain data, as well as determining the best tool to use for an experiment are important skills that a student develops in the experimentation stage of a project. The techniques that a student learns mecome an important a resource. The experimentation stage of the project introduces students to techniques and skills, which through practice, precision, and dedication beget mastery. These skills are transferable to any future lab environment a student encounters. The quality of results in a project hinges on the careful execution of techniques and protocols by the student. The final resource that is critical to student success is guidance by the mentor or instructor. Without a mentor who is patient and engaged in all stages of the independent research project, the techniques cannot be properly taught and the tools are rendered useless. The mentor watches over the student after teaching the tools and techniques, but it is the student who is responsible for the success or failure of a given experiment. Although the mentor is critical in guiding the student through the research project, they are not the only guide students must have have comfort reaching out to, learning to collaborate with other students, teachers, and professionals alike.</p>

        <h2>Collaboration</h2>
        <p>Collaborating with other mentors and professionals is important in order to develop additional techniques needed in the research project. Prior to discussing the research project with outside professionals, the student must fully gain confidence and understand the core concepts and methods of the project, question the topics that are still met with difficulty, and intelligently discuss the future direction of the project based on results. As collaboration is a critical part of professional research, it is also a critical step in preparing students for a future in science. Collaboration with other students is also a necessary part of the independent research project. Students involved in research will collaborate in a peer to peer format, where students discuss topics, review others work, and provide feedback. This peer to peer collaboration is important for the students because it allows for independent growth in the project without the direct oversight and guidance of the mentor. When a student reaches the later stages of research, the student will also collaborate with others in more of a mentor role, where students who are newer to research or struggling with a technique or protocol can receive guidance from the more advanced student.</p>

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>Running an assay or experiment is important in order to obtain data and results. Learning to analyze the results can be a more difficult task. Proper analysis includes dissection and interpretation of the data, plotting data into easy to understand visual charts, determination of statistical significance, and differentiatie neuances between correlation and causation. In addition to analyzing the data, students must also analyze the research project as a whole. By analyzing the overall project, students ensure that the core concepts of the project are understood, that necessary and logical experiments were carried out, and that the data is meaningful and easily understood. Once all of the analysis has been carried out, the student is ready for the culminating stage of the independent research project.</p>

        <h2>Presentation</h2>
        <p>The experience of carrying out a research project and putting into practice the information that is learned in the classroom is critical in this model, in order to change the way science is taught in this country. However, after all of the lab work and analysis is completed, it is necessary for a student to share the findings in the same way that a professional would. Students must compile the findings of the study in the form of a written report, poster, oral presentation, or in some cases, a publication. This process allows students to practice important presentation and technical writing skills that will be needed in future education and careers. This also allows the students to showcase work that they were involved in for months or even years, and receiving feedback in order to make improvements.</p>
        <h2>Chemistry/Nanotechnology</h2>
        <p>Students in this program are provided the tools and technical expertise to synthesize, manipulate, analyze and visualize interesting nanoscale structures for various applications. Research projects may incorporate the use of UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry, Atomic absorption spectroscopy, Dynamic light scattering particle size analyzer, and/or Contact angle measurement tool equipped with a high speed camera in the areas of nanomaterial fabrication. Last year, the lab added equipment to facilitate high-level organic synthesis research (a benchtop Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and air-sensitive lithium ion battery research (Glove box). This year, a senior student developed methodology to turn mechanical movements into electricity using nanofiber generators; the work was presented at the National Junior Science and Humanities Symposium and recognized by Intel and Siemens.</p>

        <h1>Types of Research Opportunities</h1>
        <h2>Molecular Biology and Genetics</h2>
        <p> Students pursuing this research program option learn how the programming of living cells can be altered through the manipulation of genetic information. Through their research, students learn how to clone, modify, and transfer genes to cultured cells and organisms, as well as what goes into the propagation and differentiation of stem cells. Several students this year made major advances in their research projects. One student developed a sensitive assay to identify and quantitate deletions in mitochondrial DNA, and subsequently demonstrated that these deletions correlate with certain cellular events in stem cells, notably aging. He won second prize at the Intel Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) and became a Google semifinalist with this work. A recent graduate studied the role of the human sirtuin 1 gene (SIRT1), a survival gene that protects cells from stress, in the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) and tau proteins in a neuroblastoma cell line. Another student studied the role of the human sirtuin 1 gene (SIRT1), a survival gene that protects cells from stress, in the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) and tau proteins in a neuroblastoma cell line. Such work could contribute to our understanding of the development of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. Aishwarya won first prize at the ISEF competition  and was also named a Finalist in the Biogenius competition in Boston. </p>

        <h2>Cell Biology Research</h2>
        <p>Research in this laboratory utilizes cellular and molecular biology techniques in the elucidation and manipulation of signal transduction pathways to address pertinent topics in medicine and health, food security, and water quality.  Young innovators are using CRISPR/cas9 gene editing to address cancer cell proliferation, exosome delivery of miRNA for therapy, plant immune system elicitors to decrease the use of pesticides, and peptides to decrease potential biofilm formation in water delivery systems in developing countries.   This lab has produced an invitee to the White House Science Fair, 5 INTEL Science Talent Search Finalists, a first place finalist at the Junior Science and Humanities Symposium, as well as over 50 finalists and semifinalists in INTEL STS, Siemens, Google Science Fair, ISEF, BioGENEius, Junior Science and Humanities Symposium, and the American Academy of Sciences. Students have published in peer reviewed journals and have collaborated with scientists in academia. Research students in this lab also facilitate the annual Bergen SciChallenge, a Broadcom Masters affiliated middle school science fair.</p>
        <h2>Experimental Psychology</h2>
        <p>Students in this research program use proven methods to study psychological disorders and processes. The program guides students in the development of laboratory techniques necessary to explore the mind and behavior, as well as the study of perception, memory, thinking, and learning.</p>
        <h2>Math Research Program</h2>
        <p>The Math research program is aimed at preparing students for contests based on math research such as Siemens and Intel talent search. The students write papers in Combinatorics, Number Theory, Geometry etc. Every year our students win math grants through YSAP. They also take part in NJRSF,ISEF, AMC 10, AMC 12, AIME, USA Math Olympiad and the International Math Olympiad. This year a student won the USA Math Olympiad and a gold medal at the International Math Olympiad in Thailand.
